# Smart Recipe Generator - Technical Approach

## Problem-Solving Strategy
I built a comprehensive recipe suggestion system using a hybrid ML approach combining TF-IDF vectorization with cosine similarity for intelligent recipe matching. The system processes user ingredients and applies advanced scoring algorithms (40% ML similarity + 40% ingredient matching + 20% coverage score) to recommend optimal recipes.

## Technical Implementation
- **Backend**: Flask REST API with modular architecture
- **ML Engine**: scikit-learn for text vectorization and similarity computation
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with modern ES6+ features for optimal performance
- **Database**: JSON-based storage with 22+ diverse recipes across multiple cuisines
- **Computer Vision**: Mock implementation demonstrating ingredient detection workflow

## Key Features
- Real-time ingredient autocomplete and substitution suggestions
- Advanced filtering (dietary restrictions, cooking time, difficulty, cuisine)
- Responsive mobile-first design with drag-and-drop image upload
- User feedback system with star ratings and favorites
- Comprehensive error handling and loading states

## Architecture Decisions
I chose Flask for its simplicity and Python's ML ecosystem compatibility. The hybrid scoring algorithm ensures both semantic similarity and practical ingredient availability. The modular frontend architecture enables easy feature expansion while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

**Total Development Time**: ~6 hours
**Lines of Code**: ~800 (Python) + ~600 (JavaScript) + ~400 (CSS)
