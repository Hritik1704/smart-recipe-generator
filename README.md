### Request/Response Examples

#### Recipe Suggestion Request
```json
{
  "ingredients": ["chicken", "broccoli", "garlic"],
  "dietary_restrictions": ["gluten_free"],
  "max_cooking_time": 30,
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "cuisine_preference": "Asian"
}
```

#### Recipe Suggestion Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "recipes": [
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Chicken Teriyaki Stir Fry",
      "match_score": 85.2,
      "ingredient_match_percentage": 75.0,
      "missing_ingredients": ["soy sauce", "ginger"],
      "substitution_suggestions": {
        "soy sauce": ["tamari", "coconut aminos"]
      },
      "ingredients": ["chicken breast", "broccoli", "garlic", "soy sauce", "ginger"],

    }
  ],
  "total_found": 1,
  "ml_powered": true
}
```

## 🎯 Key Implementation Details

### Machine Learning Algorithm
The recipe recommendation system uses:
1. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts recipe text (ingredients + metadata) into numerical vectors
2. **Cosine Similarity**: Measures similarity between user query and recipes
3. **Hybrid Scoring**: Combines ML similarity (40%) + ingredient matching (40%) + coverage score (20%)

### Ingredient Detection
- Mock implementation for demonstration purposes
- Simulates computer vision with random ingredient detection
- Returns confidence scores for detected ingredients
- Supports common image formats (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, BMP)

### Dietary Restrictions
- **Vegetarian**: Filters out meat-based recipes
- **Vegan**: Excludes dairy, eggs, and animal products
- **Gluten-Free**: Removes recipes containing gluten
- **Dairy-Free**: Excludes dairy-containing recipes

### Substitution Engine
Provides intelligent substitutions for missing ingredients:
- Butter → Olive oil, Coconut oil, Margarine
- Milk → Almond milk, Soy milk, Coconut milk
- Eggs → Flax eggs, Chia eggs, Applesauce
- And many more...
